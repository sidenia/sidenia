### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

ðŸ˜„ Si it's my nickname and I'm a traveler! I love new cultures and mingle with people.

ðŸŒ±I'm currently learning some programming languages and I'm really excited! Despite studing backend (Java) at the University I discovered my passion for Front End, so I'm dedicating my time to learn on my own the basis (HTML, CSS and JS), after that I intend to follow the path to become a web full stack developer! I'm respecting my time of learning and trying do not feel pressured by the fast paced enviroment we are envolved! 

I share with you guys my current portifolio https://portifolio.sidenia.repl.co/ . I'm working to make a new version but my knowledge is still limited to do what I definetily want, so this will be scenes from the next chapters.
